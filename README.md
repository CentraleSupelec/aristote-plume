# Plume (Aristote)

This technical README should help you set up a local development environment for the Aristote Plume project. This
project is an integration of the [Storm method](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm) in a web application, allowing
authenticated users to generate wikipedia-like synthesis on any science subject, with sources quotation.

## Launch the application locally

## Prerequisites

* Git
* Docker and docker compose

### Quick start (with docker)

Run the following command to build and start the project :

```shell
ln -s ../../webapp/bin/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit # pre-commit script (to run php-cs-fixer)
cp -f ./webapp/.env ./webapp/.env.local
cp -f ./webapp/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php ./webapp/.php-cs-fixer.php
cp -f ./backend/.env.dist ./backend/.env
echo "127.0.0.1 aristote-plume-local.centralesupelec.fr" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm -it --entrypoint "" php php composer install
docker compose run --rm -it --entrypoint "" assets npm install
docker compose up -d
```

Make sure to adjust the `webapp/.env.local` file to your needs. Some values are just placeholders for secrets, or will
depend on your configuration. Take a look at the [web application configuration](#web-application-configuration) section
of the readme.

You also need to adjust the `backend/.env` to configure the backend workers, in charge of generating the articles. Take
a look at the [associated section of the readme](#python-backend-configuration).

## Web application configuration

### Users authentication: OIDC

Users authentication is delegated to an external provider with
[OpenID Connect protocol](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). The following environment variables must be
configured:

```dotenv
OIDC_WELL_KNOWN_URL="Your OIDC server well known URL"
OIDC_CLIENT_ID="The client ID"
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="The client secret"
OIDC_SCOPES="OIDC scopes as comma separated values (e.g. 'openid' or 'openid,profile,email')"
OIDC_USER_IDENTIFIER_PROPERTY="Must be the user email"
OIDC_USER_IDENTIFIER_FROM_ID_TOKEN="Whether email should be obtained from the userinfo endpoint (0) or id token (1)"
```

If you do not have an OIDC provider to configure, or if it is not possible to set it up for your development
environment, you can set up a
[keycloak OIDC server](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#con-oidc_server_administration_guide) locally
and use it as an OIDC provider.

[//]: # (TODO: add more documentation on how to setup keycloak locally + add keycloak to docker compose file.)

### Object storage: minio

In the local development environment, [minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/container/index.html) is used to provide object
storage with s3 apis compatibility. To configure `minio`:

1. Go to the [minio admin dashboard](http://localhost:9091), and log in as administrator (root credentials in
   environment variables of the `minio` service in [compose.yml](compose.yml))
2. Create a bucket for the application (`plume-local`)
3. Create an access key, and report its identifier / secret in the corresponding environment variables
   (`S3_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`)

The following environment variables can now be configured:

```dotenv
S3_STORAGE_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000
S3_STORAGE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY=generated-articles
S3_STORAGE_REGION=eu-west-2
S3_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=plume-local
S3_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=change_me
S3_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=change_me
```

This configuration should not be used as-is in a production environment (minio should be configured more finely).

## Python backend configuration

Article generation is handled by a python celery worker, exposed with a fast api application.

## Launch application

### Access to a text generation inference API

The application relies on large language models to generate articles content. This can be configured with the three
following variables (the environment file path is `backend/.env`):

```shell
# Aristote dispatcher configuration (LLM endpoint)
ARISTOTE_DISPATCHER_URI=https://open-ai-compatible-api-uri.com
ARISTOTE_DISPATCHER_PORT=443
ARISTOTE_DISPATCHER_API_KEY=change_me
```

[Aristote Dispatcher](https://github.com/CentraleSupelec/aristote-dispatcher) is CentraleSup√©lec's gateway project to
expose LLM inference servers, but any api following openai schema should work fine.

### Object storage: minio

The same environment variables as the ones passed to the webapp have to be set for the python backend. Please refer to
the [web application configuration section](#object-storage-minio) for details (the environment file path is
`backend/.env`).

### Celery backend: redis

Redis is used as a key-value store for php sessions of the web application, and also as a backend for `Celery`. It must
be accessible for both the fastapi application and the celery worker.

Default settings should work fine, but if you want to change it you should edit both
[the backend environment file](./backend/.env) and the [docker compose file](./compose.yml).
